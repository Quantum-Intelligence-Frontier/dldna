    "## Building a Small but Powerful Language Model: Uncovering the Secrets of DeepSeek and Phi-3\n",
    "\n",
    "While large language models (LLMs) are making tremendous progress, they come with significant computational resource consumption and environmental issues. Training and operating LLMs with billions of parameters requires an enormous amount of GPUs, leading to increased carbon emissions and accelerated global warming. Furthermore, the high costs involved in developing LLMs mean that only a few large corporations can lead their development, hindering AI technology democratization and deepening dependence on specific companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, \"small but powerful\" small language models (SLMs) are emerging as a new alternative for sustainable AI development. SLMs can deliver sufficient performance with limited computational resources, allowing individual developers or small research groups to participate in AI technology development. Additionally, they can reduce energy consumption, alleviate environmental burdens, and lower dependence on specific hardware or platforms, ensuring AI technology diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will conduct an in-depth analysis of the recently popular SLMs, DeepSeek and Phi-3, and provide a guide on how to build your own efficient language model based on their design philosophy and training techniques.\n",
