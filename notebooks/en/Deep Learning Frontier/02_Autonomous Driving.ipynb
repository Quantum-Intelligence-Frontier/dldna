    "# Creating Autonomous Vehicles like Tesla: Technology that Sees the World with Only Cameras\n",
    "\n",
    "The innovator of autonomous driving, Tesla. Why did they choose to see the world with only cameras, without LiDAR and radar? This is not just a choice for cost reduction, but a bold vision to create an autonomous driving system that recognizes and judges the world like humans. Especially, Tesla's End-to-End deep learning-based autonomous driving, introduced from version 12, is an innovative attempt that is completely different from the traditional modular approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional autonomous driving systems consist of several modules, such as perception, which processes sensor data, prediction, which determines the situation, planning, which plans the route, and control, which controls the vehicle. Each module is developed independently and connected, but this process can cause information loss or errors, making it difficult to optimize the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Tesla's End-to-End deep learning approach takes image data collected from camera sensors as input and directly outputs control signals for steering, acceleration, and deceleration. This is like a human seeing with their eyes and judging with their brain to move their body, integrating the entire autonomous driving system into one large neural network. This approach has the potential to simplify the data processing process, maximize the efficiency of the entire system, and improve the ability to cope with unpredictable situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following chapters, we will deeply analyze Tesla's unique vision-centered, End-to-End deep learning autonomous driving approach and present a way to implement it directly using the CARLA simulator.\n",
