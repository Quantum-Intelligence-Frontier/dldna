    "# Chapter 9 Evolution of Transformers: Towards Efficiency and Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Efficiency is the bridge to intelligence.\" - Alan Turing\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the emergence of Transformers in 2017, large language models like BERT and GPT have been continuously developed, opening a new era for artificial intelligence with their remarkable performance. However, behind these successes lay fundamental limitations of the Transformer architecture and efforts to overcome them. To address issues such as computational complexity and limitations in handling long texts, continuous improvements and structural proposals were made. Especially after 2019, as model sizes rapidly increased, research on efficiency became more active.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major Changes by Period:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   2019-2020: Focus on reducing complexity\n",
    "*   2021-2022: Focus on memory efficiency\n",
    "*   2023-2024: Focus on scalability and special purposes (ethics, open models, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter examines the limitations of Transformers and discusses various methods to address these issues in detail.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 9.1 Limitations and Challenges of Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Challenge:** How can we reduce the computational complexity and memory usage of Transformer models to process longer contexts and train larger models?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Researcher's Dilemma:** While Transformer models performed exceptionally well, their computational costs were enormous. The attention mechanism, in particular, had a complexity proportional to the square of the sequence length, severely limiting model scalability. Researchers had to find ways to maintain the core functionality of attention while increasing computational efficiency. This wasn't about simply reducing model size but seeking innovative solutions at the algorithmic and hardware levels. It was akin to building a large structure while minimizing the weight and cost of each brick.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quadratic complexity of attention operations, limited context length, and memory efficiency issues were major obstacles to model expansion. These limitations became crucial factors in determining the direction of Transformer development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.1.1 Fundamental Limitations of Transformer Architecture: Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "During the process of scaling up Transformer models, the complexity of attention operations, particularly the complexity proportional to the square of the sequence length, was a significant problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis of Attention Operation Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  $QK^T$ calculation: $O(N^2d)$ (d: embedding dimension)\n",
    "2.  Softmax operation: $O(N^2)$\n",
    "3.  Product of softmax result and V: $O(N^2d)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine the actual code performance and memory usage."

    "### 9.1.2 Basic Limitations of Transformer Architecture: Memory Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important limitation is memory efficiency. Especially for large language models, there are the following memory burdens.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, there is a memory burden due to the KV cache. In the self-recurrence generation process, the Key and Value values of the previous time step must be stored, which increases linearly with the sequence length. For example, in the case of GPT-3, about 16MB of KV cache is required for each layer when processing 2048 tokens.\n",
    "Second, there are memory requirements during backpropagation. The transformer stores intermediate activation values (activation value) - intermediate calculation results that occur in the attention layer (Q, K, V transformation values, attention scores, softmax outputs, etc.). This burden increases rapidly as the number of layers increases. In the case of BERT-large, about 24GB of memory was required for a single batch.\n",
    "Third, there is the memory usage of the attention operation itself. The attention score matrix has a size proportional to the square of the sequence length, which becomes a serious bottleneck when processing long documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these memory issues, optimization techniques such as gradient checkpointing, mixed precision training, and FlashAttention have been proposed.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Sparse Transformer's Fixed Patterns**\n",
    "\n",

    "2.  **Local pattern:** It calculates attention only with tokens within a fixed-size window.\n",

    "\n",
    "$Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(\\frac{QK^T \\odot M}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$\n",
    "\n",
    "where M is the sparse mask matrix, and ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication. The mask matrix indicates which token pairs to apply attention to (1) or not to apply (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach improved computational efficiency but had the drawback of having fixed patterns that were inflexible and unable to adapt to different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Longformer's Local-Global Combination**\n",

    "In 2020, Allen AI proposed a more flexible sparse pattern through the Longformer. The Longformer uses a hybrid approach that combines **local attention** and **global attention**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Local attention:** Each token calculates attention with its surrounding w tokens (using a sliding window approach).\n",
    "2.  **Global attention:** Special tokens (e.g., [CLS]) calculate attention with all tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows for a richer understanding of context by considering both local and global contexts simultaneously."

    "\n",
    "From 2021 to 2022, the focus was on improving the memory efficiency of transformers. In particular, optimization considering the GPU memory hierarchy and efficient implementation of attention operations were notable. The methods of this period made it possible to implement large language models practically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.3.1 FlashAttention: Attention Optimization Using GPU Memory Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, Tri Dao's research team at Stanford University proposed FlashAttention, which considers the GPU memory hierarchy. This was a hardware-centered improvement that fundamentally redesigned the memory access pattern of attention operations. FlashAttention significantly improved the training and inference speeds of transformer models, especially those processing long sequences, contributing greatly to the development of large language models. FlashAttention v2, announced in 2023, further optimized the original FlashAttention, achieving 2-4 times faster speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.3.1.1 GPU Memory Structure and IO Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of FlashAttention lies in its explicit consideration of the GPU's memory hierarchy. GPUs have two types of memory: large but slow HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) and small but fast SRAM. HBM has a large capacity but slow access speed, while SRAM has a small capacity but very fast access speed. FlashAttention utilizes these characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Minimizing data movement between HBM and SRAM:** Conventional attention mechanisms had to store the entire large attention score matrix in HBM after calculating the inner product of queries and keys. This consumes significant memory bandwidth and causes speed degradation. FlashAttention minimizes such unnecessary data movement.\n",
    "2.  **Not storing large intermediate results (attention score matrices) in HBM:** Instead of storing intermediate calculation results in HBM, FlashAttention maintains them in SRAM while performing necessary operations.\n",
    "3.  **Progressively calculating softmax in SRAM:** Rather than performing softmax operations on the entire attention score matrix at once, it calculates softmax block by block and accumulates the results. This reduces the need to store intermediate result values in HBM and read them again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hardware-aware design significantly reduced memory access.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.3.1.2 Tiling and Block Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve memory optimization, the tiling technique was introduced. Tiling is a hardware optimization technique that divides large matrices into small blocks suitable for SRAM and processes them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Divide input matrices (Q, K, V) into blocks suitable for SRAM size\n",
    "2.  Load data from HBM to SRAM block by block\n",
    "3.  Perform block-level attention operations within SRAM\n",
    "4.  After completing attention operations for each block, store only the result of that block (i.e., the weighted average of the block's value) in HBM. Do not store the entire attention score.\n",
    "\n",
    "This block processing strategy enabled the calculation of accurate attention results while minimizing memory bandwidth usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.3.1.3 FlashAttention v2: Maximizing Hardware Utilization\n",
    "\n",
    "FlashAttention v2 added several low-level optimizations to maximize hardware utilization while maintaining the basic ideas of v1. It achieved 2-4 times speed improvement compared to v1 and showed particularly superior performance in processing long sequences.\n",
    "*   **Kernel Fusion:** FlashAttention v2 integrated multiple operations of the attention mechanism, such as query, key, value transformations, attention score calculation, softmax, and weighted average calculation, into a single CUDA kernel. This minimized the number of times intermediate results were stored in and read from HBM, reducing memory bandwidth usage and improving speed.\n",
    "*   **Non-sequential Attention Head Processing:** Unlike previous versions that processed attention heads sequentially, FlashAttention V2 processes them in parallel as much as GPU resources allow, reducing latency.\n",
    "*   **Cache-friendly Memory Layout:** A data structure was designed to better fit the GPU cache line, such as storing data in column-major order. This reduced cache misses and improved data access speed.\n",
    "*   **Warp-level Parallelization:** The 32 threads within a CUDA warp were utilized to process each part of the attention operation in parallel as much as possible. This maximized the use of the GPU's SIMD characteristics and parallel processing capabilities, increasing calculation speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these comprehensive optimizations, FlashAttention v2 achieved up to 20 times better memory efficiency and 2-4 times faster speed than the existing PyTorch attention implementation in certain environments. The success of FlashAttention demonstrated the importance of algorithm design based on a deep understanding of hardware characteristics and became a key technology for large language models such as GPT-4 and Claude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official implementation of FlashAttention is provided as NVIDIA CUDA code. In PyTorch, it can be used through the flash-attn package, and it has also been integrated into the latest version of the Hugging Face transformers library."

    "## 9.4 Scalability and Specialized Architectures (2023-2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "As of 2023, the development of transformer models has entered a new phase, exploring architectures that prioritize scalability and specialized purposes beyond efficiency. The foundational technologies accumulated over the previous periods (Sections 9.2 and 9.3), such as FlashAttention, MQA/GQA, and efficient KV cache management, have become the cornerstone for solving larger and more complex problems. Building on these technological advancements, researchers have begun developing transformer models that not only scale in size but are also designed with structures optimized for specific problem domains, can control model behavior, and possess the capability to process diverse forms of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.4.1 Long Context Processing: Extending Context Length\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to understand and process long contexts is crucial in various fields, including conversational AI, document summarization, code generation, and scientific research. Early transformer models (Section 9.1) were largely limited to processing contexts of 512 or 1024 token lengths, but around 2023, models emerged that could handle contexts of up to 100K (100 thousand) and even 1M (1 million) tokens, marking significant progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.4.1.1 Hierarchical Attention and Recurrent Memory Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "The core technologies for effectively processing long contexts can be broadly categorized into the efficientization of attention mechanisms, hierarchical/recursive processing, and the introduction of memory mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The basic attention mechanism in transformers has a computational complexity proportional to the square of the sequence length (O(N²)), making it inefficient for handling long sequences. Therefore, various efficient attention techniques discussed in Section 9.2 are utilized as core components of long context models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Linear Attention:** A method to reduce the attention operation's complexity to O(N).\n",
    "        *   **Performer:** Uses the FAVOR+ (Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features) algorithm to approximate the attention matrix without explicit calculation, using the expected value of kernel functions. (Section 9.2.1.1)\n",
    "        *   **Linformer:** Reduces computation by expressing the attention matrix as a product of smaller matrices through low-rank approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Sparse Attention:** Instead of calculating attention for all token pairs, this method applies attention only to certain token pairs based on specific patterns. (Section 9.2.1.2)\n",
    "        *   **Sparse Transformer:** Uses fixed patterns to reduce attention calculation, combining stride and local patterns.\n",
    "        *   **Longformer:** Combines sliding window attention and global attention to consider both local and global information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Reformer:** Introduced in Section 9.2.3.1, LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) attention hashes query and key vectors, assigning similar vectors to the same bucket and calculating attention only within the same bucket.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   **BigBird:** A hybrid approach introduced in Section 9.2.3.2 that combines local, global, and random attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Hierarchical Attention**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hierarchical processing involves dividing the input sequence into smaller segments and applying attention mechanisms at multiple levels to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. This approach is particularly useful for long sequences where direct application of standard attention mechanisms becomes computationally prohibitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention:** An extension of the multi-head attention mechanism, where the input sequence is first divided into chunks, and then each chunk is processed through a separate set of attention heads. This allows the model to capture dependencies at different scales.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   **Recurrent Transformer:** Incorporates recurrent connections into the transformer architecture, allowing it to maintain a hidden state over time. This enables the model to process sequences one step at a time, making it more suitable for real-time applications or very long sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Memory Mechanisms**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The introduction of external memory mechanisms allows transformer models to store and retrieve information from previous inputs, effectively extending their context window beyond what is feasible with attention alone. This is particularly useful in applications where the model needs to keep track of information over long ranges, such as in question answering tasks or dialog systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Memory-Augmented Transformer:** Enhances the transformer architecture with an external memory module that can store and retrieve key-value pairs. The model can write information into this memory during encoding and read from it during decoding, facilitating the retention of information over long sequences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   **Compressive Memory:** A mechanism designed to efficiently store past experiences in a compressed form, allowing the model to retain a large amount of information without significant increases in computational cost or memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating these technologies, transformer models can be made more scalable and adaptable to specialized tasks, leveraging their strengths in handling complex dependencies while mitigating their weaknesses related to sequence length limitations.\n",
    "Hierarchical attention is a method that processes the input sequence by dividing it into multiple layers. Each layer has a different scope and resolution, with lower layers handling local context and upper layers handling global context.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How it works:**\n",
    "    1.  The input sequence is divided into small segments or blocks.\n",
    "    2.  Local attention (e.g., sliding window attention) is performed within each segment to extract local information.\n",
    "    3.  A representation is generated for each segment (e.g., average pooling, CLS token, or learned representative vector).\n",
    "    4.  Global attention is performed on the segment representations to capture long-range dependencies.\n",
    "    5.  Additional layers can be added as needed to handle wider ranges of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Advantages:**\n",
    "    *   **Reduced computational complexity:** Much fewer calculations are required compared to performing direct attention on the entire sequence.\n",
    "    *   **Capturing various levels of contextual information:** Both local and global information is considered, creating a richer contextual representation.\n",
    "    *   **Easy parallelization:** Each segment can be processed independently, making parallel processing easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Examples:**\n",
    "    *   **Longformer:** Uses a hierarchical structure that combines sliding window attention (local) and global attention (on some tokens).\n",
    "    *   **ETC (Extended Transformer Construction):** An extension of Longformer, improved to handle longer contexts.\n",
    "    *   **H-Transformer (Hierarchical Transformer):** Models context hierarchically using multiple layers of attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Recurrent Memory Transformer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Recurrent Memory Transformer incorporates the idea of RNNs into transformers, maintaining information from previous sequences in a \"memory\" form and utilizing this memory when processing current sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Transformer-XL (2019):** Introduced relative positional encoding and segment-level recurrent mechanisms, allowing for modeling long-range dependencies beyond fixed-length context windows.\n",
    "    *   **Relative Positional Encoding:** Encodes the relative distance between tokens instead of absolute position information, helping the model generalize to longer sequences.\n",
    "    *   **Segment-Level Recurrence:** Caches the hidden state of previous sequence segments and utilizes this cached information when processing current segments, enabling current segments to reference the context of previous segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Compressive Transformer (2019):** An extension of Transformer-XL, which stores past hidden states in a compressed memory form and uses this memory to process longer contexts.\n",
    "    *   **Compressive Memory:** Stores older information in a compressed form in the compressive memory, which can be queried to calculate additional attention.\n",
    "* **Memory Mechanism**:\n",
    "      *   **External Memory**: Introduces Key-Value memory, where the Key calculates query and attention to retrieve the most relevant value, and the value provides summarized information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Attention Sink, StreamingLLM:**\n",
    "      *  **Attention Sink:** In long text generation, the first few tokens (Sink token) are made to attend to all tokens, playing a role similar to a global token.\n",
    "      * **StreamingLLM:** A technique that efficiently manages the KV cache using the Attention Sink idea, particularly useful in streaming scenarios where unlimited-length texts need to be processed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Claude-2 (Anthropic):** An interactive AI model capable of handling contexts over 100K tokens. Claude-2 uses an improved approach combining **multi-scale attention** and **adaptive compression** to effectively process long contexts.\n",
    "    *   **Multi-scale attention:** Considers local and global information simultaneously using windows of different sizes. For example, small windows are used to understand the relationship with surrounding words, while large windows are used to grasp the context of a paragraph or document.\n",
    "    *   **Adaptive compression:** Dynamically adjusts the compression rate based on the importance of the input sequence to minimize information loss. For instance, important sentences are compressed less, while less important sentences are compressed more.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **LongLoRA:** A method for fine-tuning already trained models with minimal resources to increase context length. It improves LoRA, which has low computational costs, for long context processing.\n",
    "    *   **Shift Short Attention:** Performs efficient attention for short contexts by reducing computation. It reduces unnecessary calculations in existing attention mechanisms, increasing efficiency.\n",
    "    *   **Grouped Query, key, value Projections:** Utilizes MQA/GQA to reduce memory usage (Section 9.3.2).\n",

    "* **LongNet**: Proposed a Transformer that can process 100 million tokens using Dilated Attention (skipping attention). Dilated Attention calculates attention by selecting tokens sparsely within the window, similar to CNN's dilated convolution. This effectively increases the receptive field while reducing computation.\n",

    "### 9.4.2 Ethical/Safety Constraints: Constitutional AI\n",
    "\n",
    "From the end of 2022, with the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), concerns about their ethical and social impacts have grown. In particular, serious issues have been raised, such as LLMs generating harmful or discriminatory content, or leaking personal information. To address these problems, there has been a growing recognition that ethical constraints should be integrated into the *internal workings* of models, rather than simply post-filtering their outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mid-2023, Anthropic proposed a new approach called \"Constitutional AI\" as a solution to these issues. Constitutional AI aims to design models that behave according to explicit \"principles (constitutions)\" rather than perpetuating biases or harmfulness inherent in the training data.\n",

    "The core idea of Constitutional AI is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Explicit Constitution Definition**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Humans write down the desirable behavior principles, i.e., the \"constitution,\" that the model should follow. This constitution consists of rules to prevent harmfulness, discrimination, and personal information infringement.\n",
    "    *   **Examples:**\n",
    "        *   \"Respect users' personal information and do not collect or share it without consent.\"\n",
    "        *   \"Do not make discriminatory or biased statements regarding race, gender, religion, etc.\"\n",
    "        *   \"Do not generate violent or hateful content.\"\n",
    "        *   \"Do not provide false information or respond in a way that causes misunderstanding.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Supervised Learning Stage**\n",
    "    *   **Critique and Revision:** The LLM first generates responses in the usual way. Then, a separate \"critique model\" evaluates these responses against the constitution and revises them if violations are found.\n",
    "    *   **Refine:** The critique model provides detailed writings on whether the response violates the given principles, how it violates them, and how to revise it.\n",
    "    *   **Data Augmentation:** The original response and the revised response are paired to create new training data.\n",
    "    *   **Supervised Fine-tuning:** This data is used to fine-tune the LLM. The model learns to generate responses that comply with the constitution through the critique model's feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Reinforcement Learning Stage**\n",
    "    *   **Preference Model:** A separate model is trained to judge which of two responses better complies with the constitution.\n",
    "    *   **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):** The preference model is improved through human feedback.\n",
    "    *   **RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback):** The preference model is used to evaluate the LLM's behavior and learn in a way that reinforces constitutional compliance.\n",

    "*   **Transparency:** The model's principles of behavior are explicitly defined, making it easy to understand and track the model's decision-making process.\n",
    "*   **Controllability:** The constitution can be modified or added to, allowing for relatively easy control over the model's behavior.\n",
    "*   **Generalization:** It can respond not only to specific types of harmful content but also to various kinds of problems.\n",
    "*   **Scalability:** The model can be trained using an AI system without human intervention. (RLAIF)\n",

    "`efficient_encoder_rope.py` is an improved version of `efficient_encoder.py` that adds RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding) to process position information more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) is a new way to represent position information in transformers. Unlike traditional positional embedding, which adds a fixed vector to each position, RoPE uses a rotation matrix to encode position information. It rotates the embedding vector by a certain angle, similar to rotating a point on a 2D plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "1. First position: 0-degree rotation\n",
    "2. Second position: 30-degree rotation\n",
    "3. Third position: 60-degree rotation\n",
    "It rotates by a larger angle as the position becomes farther apart. If we convert high-dimensional vectors to 2D and visualize them, it can be represented as follows."

In particular, the advantages of RoPE may be more pronounced when handling sequences longer than the training data (length extrapolation).\n",

    "In this chapter, we designed a Transformer encoder model (v2) that implements FlashAttention using PyTorch's `F.scaled_dot_product_attention` and further improves efficiency by applying RoPE (Rotary Positional Embeddings). We trained and tested the v1 (basic Transformer encoder) and v2 (RoPE applied) models with `bert-base-uncased` and `t5-small` tokenizers using the AG News text classification dataset. The results showed that the v2 model achieved a higher accuracy (92.57%) with the `bert-base-uncased` tokenizer. This suggests that RoPE effectively encodes relative position information, improving the model's performance, especially in handling long texts.\n",
    "Both models achieved high accuracy in the 91-92% range, demonstrating that the Efficient Encoder architecture can achieve efficient and powerful performance. Additionally, when comparing the two tokenizers `bert-base-uncased` and `t5-small`, v2 using `bert-base-uncased` achieved slightly higher performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the table, the proposed Efficient Encoder model exhibits superior performance to small models like TinyBERT and achieves competitive performance compared to BERT-small. It is significant that it achieves performance close to larger models like DistilBERT-base or BERT-base with a much smaller size. This can be attributed to the combination of pre-trained tokenizers, FlashAttention, Pre-LN structure, RoPE, Xavier initialization, GELU activation function, and proper model configuration (hidden_size, num_hidden_layers, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the Efficient Encoder (v2) presented in this chapter is not only useful for understanding the core components of Transformer for educational purposes but also confirmed to be an efficient model that can achieve sufficiently competitive performance in actual applications. In particular, the application of RoPE was found to be an effective method to further enhance the model's performance."

    "\n",
    "The `simple_mistral` model maximizes efficiency and performance through core technical elements such as GQA, SWA, and RoPE. Let's analyze the operation method and advantages of each technical element in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. GQA (Grouped-Query Attention): Innovation for Memory and Computational Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "GQA is a variation of Multi-Head Attention that reduces memory usage and computational amount while maintaining performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Operation method:**\n",
    "    *   Query (Q) is divided into multiple heads, but key (K) and value (V) are divided into fewer heads.\n",
    "    *   Each Q head is assigned to a specific K/V head group.\n",
    "    *   The Q head calculates attention only for the K/V head group it is assigned to.\n",
    "    *   The `repeat_kv` function replicates the K/V tensor to match the number of Q heads, implementing this mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Advantages:**\n",
    "    *   **Reduced memory usage:** The size of the K/V tensor is reduced, allowing for a smaller KV cache size.\n",
    "    *   **Reduced computational amount:** Attention calculation amount is reduced, improving inference speed.\n",
    "    *   **Maintained performance:** The number of Q heads remains the same, so the model's representational power is not significantly degraded.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. SWA (Sliding Window Attention): Efficient Strategy for Long Sequence Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "SWA is a technique that reduces computational complexity by having each token attend only to tokens within a limited range (window).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Operation method:**\n",
    "    *   Each token attends only to tokens within a fixed-size window.\n",
    "    *   The window moves along the sequence, calculating attention at each position.\n",
    "    *   `attention_mask` is used to mask attention to tokens outside the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding): Efficient Positional Encoding\n",

    "RoPE is a technique that reduces the computational amount of positional encoding by using a rotary embedding method.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Operation method:**\n",
    "    *   The position is embedded into a fixed-size vector using a rotary matrix.\n",
    "    *   The embedded position vector is added to the input token vector.\n",
    "    *   `rotary_emb` function implements this mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Advantages:**\n",
    "    *   **Reduced computational amount:** Positional encoding calculation amount is reduced.\n",
    "    *   **Maintained performance:** The model's representational power is not significantly degraded.\n",
    "*   **Advantages:**\n",
    "    *   **Reduced computational complexity:** The number of attention calculations decreases from O(N²) to O(N*W). (N: sequence length, W: window size)\n",
    "    *   **Processing long sequences:** Memory usage is reduced, allowing for longer sequences to be processed.\n",

    "\n",
    "KV cache is an important optimization technique that improves inference speed, especially in generation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Concept:**\n",
    "    *   The KV cache stores the key (K) and value (V) tensors calculated at each decoder layer during inference and reuses them.\n",
    "    *   When generating new tokens, it uses cached values instead of recalculating K and V for previous tokens.\n",
    "    *   The `past_key_values` parameter stores the KV cache from the previous step, and setting `use_cache=True` activates the KV cache feature. Each layer takes `past_key_value` as input and outputs updated `present_key_value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Advantages:**\n",
    "    *   **Inference speed improvement:** Removes duplicate calculations, significantly speeding up token generation.\n",
    "    *   **Increased memory usage:** Requires additional memory to store the KV cache, but techniques like GQA and SWA can mitigate this increase.\n",

    "### 9.6.6 Basic Arithmetic Operation Prediction Example: Analyzing `train_math.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "`train_math.py` is an example that uses the `simple_mistral` model to predict the results of basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication). This example evaluates whether the model can understand numbers and operation symbols and perform simple mathematical reasoning. Training data examples are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Sample 1: 4*1=4<eos>\n",
    "Sample 2: 9+8=17<eos>\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Data Generation and Preprocessing: Harmony of Symbols and Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The `train_math.py` example has several important differences from the previous numerical sequence prediction example in terms of data generation, tokenization, model setup, etc. The biggest difference is that the data handled is not a simple list of numbers, but an \"expression\" consisting of numbers, operation symbols, equals signs, and `<eos>` tokens indicating sentence termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`create_arithmetic_data` function: Generating arithmetic data**\n",
    "    *   This function generates a specified number (`num_samples`) of arithmetic expressions and their results as strings.\n",
    "    *   Each expression follows the format `f\"{num1}{op}{num2}={result}<eos>\"` (e.g., `\"12+7=19<eos>\"`).\n",
    "        *   `num1`, `num2`: Integers randomly chosen between 1 and `max_value`.\n",
    "        *   `op`: An operation symbol randomly chosen from addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), and multiplication (`*`).\n",
    "        *   `result`: The actual result calculated using Python's `eval` function.\n",
    "        *   **Importance of the `<eos>` token:** Explicitly adding the `<eos>` (End-of-Sentence) token to the end of the string is crucial. This special token serves as a marker to inform the model of the sentence's end. Without the `<eos>` token, the model may struggle to determine when to stop generating and could output numbers or symbols indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`create_tokenizer` function: Defining the vocabulary dictionary**\n",
    "    *   Creates a vocabulary dictionary that includes digits (0-9), operation symbols ('+', '-', '*'), equals signs ('='), and special tokens (`<pad>`, `<eos>`). This dictionary defines the basic characters that the model can understand.\n",
    "        *   The `<pad>` token is a padding token used to bundle sequences of different lengths into one batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`create_reverse_tokenizer` function: Converting token IDs back to characters**\n",
    "    *   Creates an inverse dictionary that converts token IDs back to string tokens. This is used to interpret the generated results in a human-readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`tokenize_sample` function: Converting strings to token lists**\n",
    "    *   The `tokenize_sample` function converts sample strings into token lists that the model can recognize.\n",
    "        - Special tokens like `<eos>` are processed as single tokens so that the model can fully recognize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`ArithmeticDataset` class: Converting data into a trainable format**\n",
    "* The `create_arithmetic_data` function converts the generated data into PyTorch's `Dataset` format. `Dataset` is a standardized way to efficiently supply data to the model.\n",
    "* The `__getitem__` method performs the following tasks:\n",
    "    1. Tokenizes the sample string using the `tokenize_sample` function.\n",
    "    2. If the length of the tokenized sequence is shorter than the specified `seq_length`, it pads the sequence with `<pad>` tokens to make all input sequences the same length, allowing the model to process them in batches.\n",
    "    3. Converts the tokens to integer IDs and returns the input sequence and label sequence (same as input) as PyTorch tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Configuration and Training\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`MistralConfig` settings:** Since this task is slightly more complex than the number sequence prediction example, the model size has been increased (`hidden_size=64`, `intermediate_size=128`, `num_hidden_layers=3`, `num_attention_heads=8`, `num_key_value_heads=4`). Additionally, `pad_token_id` and `eos_token_id` are set so that the model can recognize padding tokens and end-of-sentence tokens.\n",
    "* **Training:** The `train` function is used to train the model, similar to the previous example. The `CosineAnnealingLR` scheduler is used to gradually decrease the learning rate, allowing for rapid convergence in the early stages of training and fine-tuning in the later stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`generate_text` function:** Given a prompt (e.g., \"12+7=\"), the model generates text (arithmetic result). The generation stops when the model produces an `<eos>` token or a `<pad>` token.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training results:** During training, the loss decreases gradually, indicating that the model is learning arithmetic patterns.\n",
    "* **Generation results:** Using evaluation data examples, it is verified whether the model generates correct operation results for given prompts (e.g., \"4+20=\" -> \"4+20=24\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The `train_math.py` example demonstrates that the `simple_mistral` model can learn symbolic reasoning abilities, such as arithmetic, beyond simple number sequence prediction. It also highlights the importance of special tokens like `<eos>` and the need to adjust the model size according to task difficulty."

    "`train_sql.py` deals with a more complex natural language processing task using the `simple_mistral` model to convert natural language questions into SQL queries. This example examines how the model learns to understand the meaning of complex natural language sentences and express them in structured SQL query language, beyond simple sequence generation. The example consists of training data where given a sentence, it returns the sentence in SQL form. The following are examples of the training data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Sample 1: Tell me what the notes are for South Australia sep> SELECT Notes FROM table WHERE Current slogan = SOUTH AUSTRALIA eos>\n",
    "Sample 2: What is the format for South Australia? sep> SELECT Format FROM table WHERE State/territory = South Australia eos>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset and Preprocessing: Harmonizing WikiSQL and Special Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the `train_sql.py` example lies in effectively utilizing the WikiSQL dataset and preprocessing the data so that the model can learn the relationship between natural language and SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Loading WikiSQL Dataset:** The WikiSQL dataset is loaded using the `datasets` library. WikiSQL is a dataset consisting of pairs of natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries, widely used for natural language-SQL conversion tasks. The `split` argument of the `load_dataset` function can be used to specify the training (`train`) and validation (`validation`) datasets.\n",
    "*   **`WikiSQLDataset` Class:** By inheriting PyTorch's `Dataset` class, the WikiSQL dataset is processed into a form suitable for model training.\n",
    "    *   In the `__init__` method, the WikiSQL dataset is loaded, and the tokenizer (`tokenizer`) and maximum sequence length (`max_length`) are set.\n",
    "    *   The `__getitem__` method processes a data sample to convert it into a form that can be input into the model. The most important part of this process is combining natural language questions and SQL queries and adding special tokens.\n",
    "        1.  First, the natural language question (`question`) and human-written SQL query (`sql['human_readable']`) are retrieved from the sample data.\n",
    "        2.  The retrieved question and SQL query are combined in the form `\"question <sep> SQL<eos>\"`. Here, `<sep>` is a separator token that distinguishes between the question and the SQL query, and `<eos>` is an end-of-sentence token that indicates the end of the sentence. These special tokens play a crucial role in informing the model about the structure of the input text.\n",
    "        3.  The combined text is tokenized using the `tokenizer`. At this time, `truncation=True` is set to truncate the text if it exceeds `max_length`, and `padding=\"max_length\"` is set to add padding to make the sequence length equal to `max_length`.\n",
    "        4.  Finally, the tokenized `input_ids` are returned. (Input and label are the same)\n",
    "*   **Tokenizer (T5Tokenizer):** Uses the `T5Tokenizer` from the `transformers` library. The reasons for choosing `T5Tokenizer` are as follows:\n",
    "    *   It supports various special tokens (`<pad>`, `<eos>`, `<sep>`, etc.) by default.\n",
    "    *   It is a versatile tokenizer that can effectively handle both natural language and SQL queries (code).\n",
    "    *   The vocabulary size of the tokenizer can be easily obtained through `tokenizer.vocab_size`, making it convenient to set the model's `vocab_size`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Data Loader (`DataLoader`):** Plays a role in efficiently supplying the dataset created through `WikiSQLDataset` to the model in mini-batch units. `batch_size` refers to the number of samples input to the model at once, and `shuffle=True` mixes the data at each epoch to enhance training effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Setup and Training\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`MistralConfig` Setting:** Sets hyperparameters related to the model's structure. In particular, it sets `pad_token_id`, `bos_token_id`, and `eos_token_id` to the corresponding token IDs of the tokenizer so that the model can correctly process padding, sentence start, and sentence end tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Model (`MistralForCausalLM`) and Optimizer (`AdamW`) Creation:** Creates a `MistralForCausalLM` model and moves it to a specified device (CPU or GPU). It uses an `AdamW` optimizer and a `get_cosine_schedule_with_warmup` scheduler to control the learning rate and optimize the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`train` Function**: Uses a general training loop, similar to those in `train_seq_num.py` and `train_math.py`, to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Generation (`generate_sql`): Inferring SQL Queries from Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`generate_sql` Function:** Uses the trained model to generate an SQL query from a given natural language question.\n",
    "    *   First, it constructs a prompt in the form of `\"question <sep> \"` by adding a `<sep>` token to the input question. This prompt clearly informs the model that the question has ended and it's time to generate an SQL query.\n",
    "    *   **Importance of Padding Token Handling:** The training data is padded up to the maximum length (`max_length`) including the `<eos>` token. However, if the training data only contains `\"question <sep> \"` without the SQL part and `<eos>` (i.e., `\"question <sep> <pad> <pad> ...\"`), the model may not learn what to generate after the `<sep>` token. As a result, during generation, it might produce only padding tokens or an empty string after `<sep>`. To prevent this, the training data must be in the form of `\"question <sep> SQL<eos>\"`.\n",
    "    *   It uses the `temperature` parameter to control the diversity of generated SQL queries.\n",
    "    *   The query generation stops when the model produces a `<eos>` token or a `<pad>` token.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Sample Output**: Prints three sample outputs from the WikiSQL dataset before training to verify the data format.\n",
    "*   **Training Results:** Confirms that the model learns patterns to convert natural language questions into SQL queries as the loss decreases during training.\n",
    "*   **Generation Results:** Evaluates the generated SQL queries by inputting questions from the validation dataset into the model. It focuses on whether the generated SQL queries are grammatically correct and accurately reflect the meaning of the questions.\n",
    "The `train_sql.py` example demonstrates how to perform natural language-to-SQL conversion, a more complex natural language processing task, using the `simple_mistral` model. This example emphasizes the importance of properly utilizing special tokens (`<sep>`, `<eos>`, `<pad>`) in the data preprocessing step and how the composition of the training data affects the generation capability of the model."

    "## Robust Transformer Design and Debugging - A Practical Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a transformer model from scratch, including efficient architectures like `simple_mistral`, is a challenging but rewarding task. While theoretical understanding is crucial, the actual implementation process often encounters subtle bugs and performance bottlenecks. This section delves into practical strategies for designing, implementing, and debugging transformers, with a particular focus on the components used in `simple_mistral` (RoPE, RMSNorm, Attention). It extensively covers unit testing and discusses other essential debugging and design techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Essential Role of Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "When building complex models like transformers, unit testing is not optional but *essential*. It allows for early detection of errors, prevents regression, and gives confidence in the implementation. A well-tested model is a *reliable* model.\n",
    "\n",
    "All model sources have unit tests in a **tests directory (e.g., mistral/tests, phi3/tests)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Unit Testing is Crucial for Transformers**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Complexity:** Transformers consist of multiple interacting modules (Attention, Feedforward networks, Normalization, Embedding). Bugs can easily occur in any of these components.\n",
    "*   **Subtle Errors:** Many transformer bugs are not immediately apparent and may not cause crashes but instead lead to performance degradation or incorrect outputs. Unit tests can catch these subtle errors.\n",
    "*   **Numerical Stability:** Deep learning models, especially those using techniques like mixed precision, are vulnerable to numerical issues (NaN, Inf, Vanishing/Exploding Gradients). Unit tests help detect these problems.\n",
    "*   **Refactoring and Fixes:** Changing code while improving and optimizing the model is inevitable. Unit tests ensure that existing functionality is not broken by changes.\n",
    "*   **Reproducibility:** Well-defined tests contribute to the reproducibility of results.\n",
    "*   **Caching (`past_key_value`):** If a model uses caching like `past_key_values`, it's crucial to test for errors related to shape, dtype, or device.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Principles of Effective Unit Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Ideally, write unit tests *before* writing the model code. This forces clear thinking about the expected behavior of each component.\n",
    "*   **Modularity:** Design code in a modular fashion with small, well-defined functions and classes. This makes it much easier to isolate and test individual components.\n",
    "*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage. Test all important functions and methods of a class.\n",
    "*   **Edge Cases:** Don't just test the \"normal\" cases. Test edge cases, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios (e.g., sequences of length 0, single-element batches, different data types).\n",
    "*   **Assertions:** Use assertions (`assert`) liberally to ensure code behaves as expected. Make assertions as specific as possible. Verify not just that the code runs without crashing but also that the *output* is correct.\n",
    "*   **Pytest:** While this chapter uses the `unittest` module for examples, the `pytest` framework is highly recommended for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Areas to Focus on for Transformer Unit Testing**\n",
    "*   **Input/Output Shape:** The most common type of error in transformer implementations is incorrect tensor shape. All tests should include assertions to check the shape of output tensors.\n",
    "*   **Data Type:** Check if the expected data type (e.g., `torch.float32`, `torch.float16`, `torch.int64`) is present for tensors.\n",
    "*   **Device Placement:** If using a GPU, ensure that tensors are on the correct device (CPU or GPU).\n",
    "*   **Numerical Stability:** Especially after operations like softmax or normalization, check for NaN (Not a Number) and Inf in tensors.\n",
    "*   **Gradient Computation:** Verify that gradients are correctly computed for all trainable parameters.\n",
    "*   **Caching (`past_key_value`):** As seen earlier, caching mechanisms are a frequent source of bugs. Thoroughly test incremental decoding.\n",

    "### 2. Beyond Unit Tests: Other Debugging Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "While unit tests are the foundation, they are not the only tool in the debugging toolkit. The following are other important strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Logging (Logging)**\n",
    "*   **Strategic Logging:** Add logging statements (`print` statements or preferably use the `logging` module) to the code to track key variables' values, tensor shapes, and execution flow. This can help quickly identify where issues arise.\n",
    "*   **Detailed Level Control:** Make logging detailed but provide a way to control the detail level (e.g., using command-line flags or environment variables). This allows for obtaining detailed information during debugging but avoiding excessive output during normal operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Attention Weights:** Visualize attention weights to see which tokens the model is paying attention to. This can help identify issues with the attention mechanism or position embedding.\n",
    "*   **Activations:** Visualize neuron activations in the model. This can help identify dead neurons (always inactive) or saturated neurons (always at maximum or minimum value).\n",
    "*   **Gradients:** Visualize gradients during training. This can help detect vanishing or exploding gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Numerical Debugging**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **NaN/Inf Check:** Use `torch.isnan()` and `torch.isinf()` to check for NaNs and Infs in tensors. This often indicates numerical instability.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if torch.isnan(tensor).any() or torch.isinf(tensor).any():\n",
    "        print(\"NaN or Inf detected!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **Gradient Checks:** Use `torch.autograd.gradcheck` to verify that custom autograd functions compute gradients correctly. This is especially important when implementing custom attention mechanisms or other complex operations.\n",
    "*   **Small Test Cases:** Create very small and simple test cases (e.g., single layer, small vocabulary, short sequence) where expected output can be manually calculated. This helps isolate bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Debugger (pdb, IDE Debugger)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`pdb` (Python Debugger):** Use the built-in Python debugger (`pdb`) to step through code line by line, inspect variables, and set breakpoints.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # Add this line to set a breakpoint.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **IDE Debuggers:** Most IDEs (PyCharm, VS Code, etc.) have integrated debuggers that provide a more user-friendly interface for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Profiling**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **PyTorch Profiler:** Use the PyTorch profiler to identify performance bottlenecks in the code. This can help find areas to optimize for speed or memory usage.\n",
    "*   **Memory Profiling:** Use tools like `memory_profiler` to track memory usage and identify potential memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Model Design Principles for Debugging Possibility**\n",
    "*   **Keep it Simple:** Start with simple models and gradually add complexity, making it easier to isolate bugs.\n",
    "*   **Modularity:** Break down code into small, well-defined modules, allowing for easier testing and debugging of individual components.\n",
    "*   **Assertions:** Use assertions to check expected conditions and catch errors early.\n",
    "*   **Comments and Documentation:** Write clear and concise comments and documentation to explain the code's logic, helping users (and others) understand the code and identify potential issues.\n",
    "*   **Reproducibility:** Use a fixed random seed to make results reproducible, which is essential for debugging and comparing different model configurations.\n",
    "*   **Overfitting on a Single Batch/Small Dataset:** Overfit the model on a small dataset before training on a larger one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Common Mistakes and Prevention Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Incorrect Tensor Shapes:** Double-check the expected shape of tensors, especially after operations like reshape, transpose, and concatenate. Frequently use `tensor.shape` in the debugging process.\n",
    "*   **Off-by-One Errors:** Be mindful of indexing when working with sequences and position embeddings.\n",
    "*   **Data Type Mismatches:** Ensure that tensors have the correct data type (e.g., `float32` vs `float16`).\n",
    "*   **Device Mismatches:** Verify that all tensors are on the same device (CPU or GPU).\n",
    "*   **Uninitialized Variables:** Initialize all variables before using them.\n",
    "*   **Incorrect Masking:** When using attention masks, ensure that the mask is applied correctly and not masking important information.\n",
    "*   **Incorrect Use of `past_key_values`:** Make sure to follow the correct usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these debugging techniques with a solid understanding of the fundamental principles of transformer models, you can solve even the most challenging implementation problems. Debugging is an iterative process, so be patient and systematically use all tools.\n",

    "## 9.7 Gemma: Exploring the Latest Open Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemma is the latest open model released by Google in February 2024. Although it does not have innovative changes in its model structure compared to Mistral, it reflects the trends of the latest models and can be useful in certain situations, making it worth exploring. Gemma adopts a Transformer-based decoder-only (Decoder-only) model architecture, like LLaMA and Mistral.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reasons to Explore Gemma\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Reflection of Latest Model Trends:** Gemma includes components widely used in the latest models, such as RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding), RMSNorm (Root Mean Square Layer Normalization), and GeGLU activation functions. These elements contribute to the model's performance and efficiency, helping to understand the latest trends. RoPE efficiently encodes relative position information, improving long sequence processing capabilities, while RMSNorm removes mean-centered operations in Layer Normalization, increasing computational efficiency. GeGLU is a variation of GLU (Gated Linear Unit), increasing the model's expressiveness through non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Various Model Sizes:** Gemma is offered in sizes of 2B, 7B, 9B, and 27B. This provides users with limited computing resources the opportunity to experiment with a relatively small model size (2B).

    "In sections 9.6 and 9.7, we explored the key elements of efficient language model architectures through Mistral and Gemma models. In this section, we will directly implement and analyze the Phi-3 Mini model developed by Microsoft, and analyze the secret to its excellent performance despite its small size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phi-3 Mini is a small language model (SLM) released by Microsoft in April 2024. With 3.8B parameters, Phi-3 Mini shows competitive performance in several benchmarks compared to larger models like Mistral (7B) and Gemma (7B), demonstrating the potential of lightweight models. In particular, Phi-3 Mini emphasizes the importance of **\"high-quality data\"** and **\"efficient architecture\"**, suggesting a new direction beyond simple model size competition. This philosophy is well reflected in the slogan \"Textbooks Are All You Need\". `simple_phi3.py` is a simplified implementation of the core components of Phi-3 Mini, and the full code is available in `chapter_09/phi3`.\n",

    "| Activation | GELU (tanh approximation) | SiLU |\n",
    "| Normalization | RMSNorm | RMSNorm |\n",
    "| Positional Encoding | RoPE | RoPE |\n",
    "| `past_key_value` | Supported (caching) | Supported (caching) |\n",

    "| Weight Tying | Ties embedding weights and output layer weights in the `post_init` method to reduce parameters and improve performance. | No explicit mention of weight tying. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Improvements**\n",
    "*   **Multi-Head Attention (MHA):** Instead of Mistral's GQA (Grouped-Query Attention), a standard MHA is used. Phi-3 Mini demonstrates that it can achieve sufficient performance without GQA.\n",
    "*   **Improved RoPE Caching:** Efficiently manages `cos` and `sin` caches within the `forward` method using `_set_cos_sin_cache` to update only when necessary. Additionally, optimizes RoPE application during incremental decoding by utilizing the `apply_rotary_pos_emb_single` function to minimize redundant calculations.\n",

    "Now, let's take a closer look at the key components of the `simple_phi3` model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. PhiMiniConfig: Model Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PhiMiniConfig` class defines the model's hyperparameters, following Phi-3 Mini's settings, which have already been detailed in Mistral and will be omitted here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. PhiMiniRMSNorm: RMS Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PhiMiniRMSNorm` class implements RMSNorm (Root Mean Square Layer Normalization) and is identical to Mistral's implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. PhiMiniRotaryEmbedding: RoPE Implementation (Improved Caching)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PhiMiniRotaryEmbedding` class implements RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding). While similar to Mistral's `MistralRotaryEmbedding`, it includes key improvements to maximize caching efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Cache Management within the `forward` Method:**\n",
    "    *   Directly uses `cos_cached` and `sin_cached` within the `forward` method, utilizing already computed values when available.\n",
    "    *   Only updates the cache by calling `_set_cos_sin_cache` when the sequence length exceeds `max_seq_len_cached`, preventing unnecessary cache creation and maximizing reuse of computed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`max_seq_len_cached`, `cos_cached`, `sin_cached` Instance Variables:**\n",
    "    *   `max_seq_len_cached`: Stores the maximum sequence length cached so far.\n",
    "    *   `cos_cached` and `sin_cached`: Store pre-computed cosine and sine values.\n",
    "    *   Managing these as instance variables allows for their reuse across `forward` method calls, enhancing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Incremental Decoding Optimization:**\n",
    "    *   `apply_rotary_pos_emb_single`: Enables the application of RoPE to only the new token during incremental decoding that uses `past_key_value`, avoiding redundant calculations since previous tokens' RoPE results are already stored in `past_key_value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These improvements significantly enhance the efficiency of RoPE operations, particularly offering performance advantages when processing long sequences or generating text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. PhiMiniAttention: Attention Mechanism (MHA, Efficient RoPE Application)\n",
    "The `PhiMiniAttention` class implements the attention mechanism of Phi-3 Mini. It uses a general Multi-Head Attention (MHA) instead of Mistral's GQA, but optimizes the RoPE application method to improve efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **MHA (Multi-Head Attention):** The number of query (Q), key (K), and value (V) heads are all the same.\n",
    "*   **Efficient RoPE Application:**\n",
    "    *   Generate position IDs differently depending on the presence of `past_key_value`.\n",
    "        *   If `past_key_value` is not present (general case): generate position IDs for the entire sequence (`0` to `q_len - 1`).\n",
    "        *   If `past_key_value` is present (incremental decoding): generate position IDs for new tokens (`past_len` to `past_len + q_len - 1`) and for the entire key sequence (`0` to `past_len + q_len - 1`).\n",
    "    *   Apply RoPE only to new tokens (queries) using the `apply_rotary_pos_emb_single` function when `past_key_value` is present (incremental decoding).\n",
    "*   **KV Caching:** Cache previous key/value tensors using `past_key_value` to speed up inference, similar to Mistral.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Helper Functions: `rotate_half`, `apply_rotary_pos_emb`, `apply_rotary_pos_emb_single`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `rotate_half`: A helper function required for RoPE implementation, identical to Mistral.\n",
    "*   `apply_rotary_pos_emb`: Apply RoPE to query (q) and key (k) tensors. Unlike Mistral, it only receives one position_ids (applied equally to queries and keys).\n",
    "*   `apply_rotary_pos_emb_single`: Apply RoPE to the input tensor `x` (query or key) in incremental decoding situations using `past_key_value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. PhiMiniMLP: FeedForward Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PhiMiniMLP` class implements a FeedForward network, which is similar to Mistral but uses the GELU activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. PhiMiniDecoderLayer: Decoder Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PhiMiniDecoderLayer` class uses a Pre-Norm structure and Residual Connection, identical to Mistral.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. PhiMiniModel: Entire Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PhiMiniModel` class constructs the entire Phi-3 Mini model, similar to Mistral.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. PhiMiniForCausalLM: Language Modeling Head\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PhiMiniForCausalLM` class adds a language modeling head (`lm_head`) to the `PhiMiniModel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`post_init` Method:**\n",
    "    *   Perform weight initialization (similar to Mistral).\n",
    "    *   **Weight Tying:** Tie the embedding weights (`self.transformer.embed_tokens.weight`) and output layer weights (`self.lm_head.weight`). This reduces the number of parameters, prevents overfitting, and generally improves performance.\n",
    "*   **`generate` Function:** A function for text generation. When `past_key_values` is present, it passes only the last token to `forward()` instead of the entire sequence to address RoPE-related issues during incremental decoding."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 9, we followed the journey of Transformer development from 2017, when the Transformer architecture was first introduced in the seminal paper \"Attention is All You Need,\" to the present day in 2025, focusing on the core drivers of **efficiency** and **scalability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Transformers showed remarkable performance but faced fundamental limitations due to the rapidly increasing computational cost and memory usage with sequence length. Chapter 9 delved into the relentless efforts to overcome these constraints, including software-based approaches (Section 9.2), the combination of hardware and software (Section 9.3), and various technical innovations for model scalability (Section 9.4). From implementation examples such as RoPE and FlashAttention (Section 9.5) to architecture analyses of state-of-the-art models like Mistral, Gemma, and Phi-3 Mini (Sections 9.6, 9.7, and 9.8), we explored both theoretical and practical aspects to shed light on efficient Transformer architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to these technical advancements, Transformers have become a powerful tool that can understand longer contexts, solve more complex problems, and be applied to a wider range of fields. We can see how **efficiency and scalability** played a crucial role in the growth of Transformers beyond simple language models to become a core driving force for AI technology development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are still challenges to be addressed. The increase in energy consumption due to model enlargement, bias and toxicity issues, and model interpretability problems are significant challenges that we must overcome in the future. Research toward safer, more reliable, and human-collaborative AI systems will continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapters 10 and 11, we will embark on a journey into the world of **multimodal** integration, where Transformers go beyond text to incorporate images, audio, video, and other types of data. Multimodal models that fuse information from multiple modalities can achieve richer and more powerful representations, enabling more complex inferences. Focusing on pioneering models like ViT, CLIP, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Flamingo, GATO, and Gemini, which combine text and images, we will explore multimodal attention mechanisms and their infinite application possibilities. The innovations in efficiency and scalability discussed in Chapter 9 will serve as a solid foundation for the future of multimodal Transformers, which will be unfolded in Chapters 10 and 11."

    "## MoE (Mixture of Experts) Architecture: Theoretical Evolution and Latest Technology Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "In the development of large language models (LLMs), Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a framework that innovatively balances model capacity and computational efficiency. MoE operates by combining multiple \"expert\" networks and selectively activating the appropriate expert through a gating network based on the input. Here, we deeply dissect the core mechanism of MoE and systematically organize the extension theory reflecting the latest research trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Theoretical Foundation of MoE\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Basic Components\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Expert Networks:** There are *N* expert networks $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^N$, typically composed of Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNs). Each expert takes an input $x$ and generates an output $E_i(x)$.\n",
    "*   **Gating Network:** The gating network $G$ takes an input $x$ and outputs weights (probabilities) for each expert. These weights indicate which expert is most suitable for the input $x$. The output of the gating network $G(x)$ is an *N*-dimensional vector, where each element $G(x)_i$ represents the weight for the *i*th expert.\n",
    "*   **Final Output:** The final output $y$ of the MoE model is calculated as the weighted sum of the expert outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G(x)_i E_i(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Sparse MoE and Dense MoE\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Dense MoE:** All experts perform calculations for all inputs, and the gating network determines the weights for each expert output using a softmax function. ($G(x) = \\text{softmax}(W_g x)$)\n",
    "*   **Sparse MoE:** Only a few experts are activated for each input. The gating network uses Top-k gating (selecting experts with the largest *k* values) or Noisy Top-k gating (used in GShard, Switch Transformer).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Mathematical Formalization and Variational Inference Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "When reinterpreting the MoE system as a probabilistic graphical model, the joint distribution of observed data $\\mathbf{x}$ and latent variables $\\mathbf{z}$ (expert selection indicators) is modeled as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{z}|\\theta) = p(\\mathbf{z}|\\theta_g)p(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{z},\\theta_e)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta_g$ represents the parameters of the gating network, and $\\theta_e$ represents the parameters of the expert networks. In the variational inference framework, the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is derived as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\phi) = \\mathbb{E}_{q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x})}[\\log p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{z})] - D_{KL}(q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x}) \\parallel p(\\mathbf{z}))$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach redefines the MoE learning process within a Bayesian inference framework, providing a theoretical foundation for knowledge partitioning between experts. Specifically, the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization technique enables the application of gradient descent by approximating the discrete expert selection process with a continuous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{z} = \\text{softmax}((\\log \\boldsymbol{\\pi} + \\mathbf{g})/\\tau)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{g}$ represents Gumbel noise, and $\\tau$ is the temperature parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Structural Innovations of Sparse MoE\n",
    "#### 2.1 Hierarchical Expert Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSeek-V2 introduced Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), which greatly reduces the Key-Value cache [5, 6]. This is achieved through an approach that dichotomizes the expert hierarchy into spatial partitioning and functional partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "$E_i(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{h=1}^H W_{h,i}^o \\cdot \\text{GeLU}(W_{h,i}^k \\mathbf{x} \\oplus W_{h,i}^v \\mathbf{x})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each expert, attention heads play the role of independent sub-experts, maximizing parameter efficiency through shared basis matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Dynamic Topology Adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mixtral 8x7B model introduced a mechanism that dynamically reconfigures the expert connection structure based on the input data. The router network has evolved from simple expert selection to a graph neural network that adjusts the connection intensity between experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "$A_{ij}^{(l)} = \\sigma(f_\\phi(\\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)}, \\mathbf{h}_j^{(l)}))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $A_{ij}$ represents the connection weight between experts $i$ and $j$, enabling multi-scale feature extraction through hierarchical attention mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Advantages and Optimization of MoE Models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Increased Model Capacity:** The number of experts can be increased to greatly increase the number of parameters, but the computational cost increases relatively little.\n",
    "*   **Computational Efficiency (Sparse MoE):** Since each token only activates a few experts, FLOPs are low.\n",
    "*   **Scaling Law:** MoE models tend to follow a more favorable scaling law than dense models.\n",
    "*   **Fine-tuning:** Experts can be fine-tuned to specialize in specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Innovative Optimization Theories\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Balanced Optimization:** To address the expert load imbalance problem, dual decomposition techniques are introduced, and Lagrange multiplier methods are used to explicitly constrain the standard deviation of expert utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{total}} = \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{task}} + \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\mathbb{E}[u_i] - \\bar{u})^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here, $u_i$ represents the utilization rate of the $i$th expert, and $\\bar{u}$ represents the target average utilization rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Multi-layered Knowledge Distillation:** Hierarchical knowledge distillation reflecting the hierarchical structure of MoE is proposed.\n",
    "    $\\mathcal{L}_{KD} = \\sum_{l=1}^{L}\\alpha_{l}D_{KL}(g^{\\text{teacher}}_{l} || g^{\\text{student}}_{l})$\n",
    "    By minimizing the KL divergence of the gating distribution $g_{l}$ at each MoE layer $l$, the transfer of expert-specialized knowledge is made possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Examples and Limitations of MoE Models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Examples\n",
    "*   **GShard:** Google's Sparse MoE model. Uses Noisy Top-k gating.\n",
    "*   **Switch Transformer:** Google's Sparse MoE model. Each token is processed by only one expert (k=1).\n",
    "*   **GLaM:** Google's Sparse MoE model (1.2T parameters).\n",
    "*   **Mistral 8x7B:** Mistral AI's Sparse MoE model. Uses Top-2 gating.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Limitations and Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Expert Imbalance (Load Imbalance):** Assigning too many tokens to a specific expert. (Solutions: Noisy Top-k Gating, Load balancing loss, Expert capacity limitation)\n",
    "*   **Difficulty in Learning Gating Network:** Difficulty in learning effective expert selection/combinations.\n",
    "*   **Communication Cost (Distributed Learning):** Potential increase in communication cost between experts.\n",
    "*   **Difficulty in Knowledge Distillation:** Due to the size of MoE models, it is difficult to distill knowledge into smaller models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Frontiers of Physical Implementation\n",
    "#### 5.1 Sparse Expert Activation Hardware\n",
    "NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU introduces a dedicated Sparse Execution Unit for MoE, accelerating Top-k routing operations.\n",
    "*   Dynamic Warp Control: Independently manages execution flow for each expert group\n",
    "*   Hierarchical Shared Memory: Optimizes intermediate result sharing between experts\n",
    "*   Asynchronous Model Parallelism: Minimizes latency when executing distributed experts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2 Quantized Expert Exchange\n",
    "Recent research has developed a technique to reduce communication bandwidth by quantizing expert parameters to 4 bits [5]. It applies differential quantization.\n",
    "$\\Delta W_{i} = \\text{sign}(W_{i}-\\hat{W})\\cdot 2^{\\lfloor \\log_{2}|W_{i}-\\hat{W}|\\rfloor}$\n",
    "where $\\hat{W}$ represents the shared base matrix, and only the deviation of each expert is quantized to minimize precision loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Latest Trends in Theoretical Extensions \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1 Continuous Expert Space\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2025, Google DeepMind's latest research proposed CES-MoE, which models experts as distributions in a continuous space rather than discrete objects. It utilizes a Brownian motion-based expert diffusion model.\n",
    "$dE_t = \\mu(E_t,t)dt + \\sigma(t)dW_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach models the gradual evolution of expert characteristics and shows excellent performance in dynamic domain adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.2 Neural ODE-based Experts\n",
    "\n",
    "Next-generation MoE architectures are exploring the replacement of expert networks with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\n",
    "$\\frac{d\\mathbf{h}(t)}{dt} = f_\\theta(\\mathbf{h}(t), t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows for modeling the temporal evolution characteristics of experts, achieving performance improvements in long-horizon inference tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Challenges and Future Directions \n",
    "#### 7.1 In-Depth Analysis of Theoretical Limits\n",
    "*   Information Bottleneck: Expert selection bias due to the limited information processing capacity of routers\n",
    "*   Non-Convex Optimization: Multiple local minima issues in the expert-gate joint space\n",

    "* Biological Plasticity Imitation\n",
    "    - Dynamic expert reconstruction using synaptic plasticity principles\n",
    "\n",

    "## Practice Problem Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Attention Mechanism Computational Complexity:** The attention mechanism calculates the relationship between each token pair. When the sequence length is n, for each of the n tokens, it needs to calculate its relationship with the other (n-1) tokens. Therefore, a total of n * (n-1) ≈ n² operations are required, making the computational complexity O(n²).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **FlashAttention Optimization:** FlashAttention maximizes the use of GPU SRAM (fast memory). It divides the input into small blocks, loads them into SRAM, performs attention operations in block units, and then writes the results back to HBM (slow memory). This reduces the number of HBM accesses, minimizes memory I/O, and increases computation speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **MQA vs. GQA:**\n",
    "    *   **MQA (Multi-Query Attention):** All heads share the same Key and Value matrices. Reducing KV cache size decreases memory usage and improves speed but may reduce expressiveness.\n",
    "    *   **GQA (Grouped-Query Attention):** Queries are divided into several groups, each sharing Key and Value matrices. GQA has higher expressiveness than MQA and better memory efficiency than Multi-Head Attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **PagedAttention & vLLM:** PagedAttention stores the KV cache in non-contiguous memory blocks (pages) using the operating system's paging concept. vLLM utilizes PagedAttention to reduce memory waste, dynamically manages the KV cache, and improves inference speed and throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Hierarchical Attention vs. Recurrent Memory Transformer:**\n",
    "    *   **Hierarchical Attention:** Inputs are processed in multiple layers (e.g., word -> sentence -> paragraph). Attention is calculated at each layer, and information is aggregated to higher layers to capture long-distance dependencies, which can increase computational costs.\n",
    "    *   **Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT):** Information from previous segments is stored as memory vectors and utilized when processing the current segment. Long sequences are divided into small segments and processed sequentially, reducing memory usage but making parallel processing difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Text Classification Code:** (Code writing omitted) Refer to the example code in Section 9.5, replace `nn.TransformerEncoderLayer` with the `efficient_encoder` function, apply FlashAttention, Pre-LN, and Gradient Checkpointing. Add dataset loading and preprocessing, model training, and evaluation codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Number-English Word Conversion:** (Code writing omitted) Load the Simple Mistral model, prepare training data consisting of number-English word pairs, train the model, and evaluate its performance on test data (e.g., BLEU score).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Natural Language-SQL Conversion:** (Code writing omitted) Load the Simple Mistral model, prepare training data consisting of natural language question and SQL query pairs, train the model, and evaluate its performance on test data (e.g., accuracy, executability).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Constitutional AI Proposal:** (Implementation omitted) Constitutional AI defines a series of rules (constitution) for model responses and evaluates or modifies them based on these rules. To apply this to transformer models, one can: (1) define ethical/safety rules, (2) add a separate module to evaluate model outputs, or (3) use loss functions reflecting the rules during fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Problems\n",
    "1.  **FlashAttention Mathematical Analysis:** (Mathematical analysis omitted) FlashAttention reduces the number of HBM accesses through block-based operations. While traditional attention requires O(n²) memory access, FlashAttention requires only O(n²/B) HBM access when the block size is B (B is limited by the GPU SRAM size).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **KV Cache Size Reduction Methods:**\n",
    "    *   **Quantization:** Reduces memory usage by representing KV cache values in low precision (e.g., 8-bit).\n",
    "    *   **Sparsity:** Compresses the KV cache by removing or zeroing out parts with low attention weights.\n",
    "    *   **Low-Rank Approximation:** Stores the KV matrix as a low-dimensional approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **New Attention Mechanism Proposal:** (Idea proposal)\n",
    "    *   **Local + Global Attention:** Processes local context (e.g., surrounding words) using traditional attention and long-range dependencies using sparse attention or memory mechanisms.\n",
    "    *   **Adaptive Attention Span:** Assigns different attention spans to each token to reduce unnecessary calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Constitutional AI Limitations and Overcoming Measures:**\n",
    "    *   **Limitations:** Ambiguity of rules (constitution), potential conflicts between rules, difficulty in dealing with new types of harmful responses.\n",
    "    *   **Overcoming Measures:** Hierarchizing/concretizing rules, introducing conflict resolution mechanisms, continuously updating and validating rules, and reinforcing learning through human feedback.\n",
